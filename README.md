# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Classifier

This project is a web application that predicts whether breast cancer is malignant or benign based on user input. It uses a logistic regression model trained on the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file that handles routing and rendering templates.
- `main.py`: Contains the machine learning model and the prediction logic.
- `static/search.css`: CSS file for styling the web pages.
- `templates/index.html`: (Currently empty) HTML template for the index page.
- `templates/predict.html`: HTML template for displaying the prediction result.
- `templates/search.html`: HTML template for the input form.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the Flask application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. Enter the required input values in the form and click "Predict" to get the prediction result.

## 📊 Input Format

The input should be a comma-separated list of 30 numerical values representing the following features:
[mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean area, mean smoothness, mean compactness, mean concavity, mean concave points, mean symmetry, mean fractal dimension, radius error, texture error, perimeter error, area error, smoothness error, compactness error, concavity error, concave points error, symmetry error, fractal dimension error, worst radius, worst texture, worst perimeter, worst area, worst smoothness, worst compactness, worst concavity, worst concave points, worst symmetry, worst fractal dimension
